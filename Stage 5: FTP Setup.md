## Prepare a Win2012r2 server

Renamed the computer host to "ftp" and initiated a system reboot. Configured IP addresses via the network adapter, assigning a static IP for stability. Established the domain controller (DC) IP address as the primary DNS server, with the firewall's DMZ IP designated as secondary. Synchronized NTP with the domain controller's time server, specifically dc.widget.localdomain. Successfully integrated into the widgets.localdomain network.

To initialize the Web Server (IIS) and FTP Server roles, access the server via an administrative account and navigate through Server Manager. Follow the prompts to select the desired roles and features, ensuring to include management tools where applicable. Add FTP users through the domain via Computer Management in Server Manager, assigning user accounts as needed. Configure global IIS settings, including FTP authentication and authorization rules, to grant appropriate access permissions. Navigate to the designated FTP root directory and create the FTP site within IIS Manager. Configure site settings such as IP address, port, and SSL options, ensuring to specify authentication methods and user access permissions. Lastly, in IIS Manager, navigate to FTP Firewall Support to configure the data channel port range, ensuring proper firewall setup. These steps establish a robust and secure FTP server environment, ready to facilitate file transfer operations effectively.
